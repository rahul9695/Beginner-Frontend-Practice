# DOM Project 1

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript project demonstrating how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the style of an HTML element dynamically.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file includes the basic structure of a webpage. It defines a `div` element with the ID "myDiv," which will be targeted and modified using JavaScript.

## JavaScript Manipulation

Inside the `<script>` tag, JavaScript is used to perform the following operations on the "myDiv" element:

1. Get a reference to the "myDiv" element using its ID.
2. Change the text color to blue.
3. Change the background color to yellow.
4. Add a margin of 20 pixels.
5. Add a padding of 10 pixels.
6. Change the font size to 18 pixels.
7. Set the font weight to bold.
8. Change the height of the div to 200 pixels.
9. Change the width of the div to 300 pixels.
